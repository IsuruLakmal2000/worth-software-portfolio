This is a React with TypeScript portfolio website for WorthSoftware. The project uses:

- Modern component architecture

## Key Guidelines:
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Follow responsive-first design principles
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Maintain consistent color scheme: #111111 (black), #555555 (gray)
- Use placeholder images for all visual content
- Implement smooth scroll animations where appropriate
